### Keep track of the great tips for career development

#### 1. Argue Wage Raise / Promotion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdibo11l8Zo

Two Principles:
1) How your manager can argue for you? (How your manager can persuade his manager and other stakeholders?)
2) Potential first(qianli), Accomplishment second (kaopu) (looking forward; what you can provide to the team next?) HUABING

Tips:
1) Give your boss an excuse to promote you, e.g. summarize your impact; and predict the questions from other stakeholders
    a. why this person?
    b. why not someone else?
    c. why this much?
    d. what's the trade-off?
2) Expression example: (need more details to support)
    In my current scope I have spent quite a bit of time to build those solutions that have worked really well. Not only were we able to achieve our goals, I also found some best practices that are widely applicable. I looked around and saw many other projects can also benefit from them. What would you say if I propose an initiative to help applying them elsewhere? This can create a lot of value for the wider group, saves everyone time, and also allows me to expand my coverage. On top of that, I would be more than happy to diversify my role as well as my skillset. Do you think that's a good idea?
    
    others e.g. not only willing to learn but also share knowledge across team to help others to speed up; take responsibilities and ownership/ push project progress; willing to take initiative and make bigger impact
    
3) Need to show:
     a. Build strong connections instead of working in silos e.g. good relationship with other teams; bring in potential customers

4) Tactics:
     a. Show work as early as possible so that give boss enough time to make this happen
     b1. Email before perf review: Before we meet for the official year-end review, I would like to have an early conversation with you about my accomplishments and development this year. Would it be okay for us to also allocate some time to discuss comp[ensation]?
     b2. Full preparation: 
     know your facts - company, org, teammates, yourself公司业务管理的痛点，同事的评价; Quantify your impact as much as possible!  
     Argument e.g. I'm proud of all the accomplishments, and more importantly I'm really excited about the growth opportunities ahead. Given that I have consistently performed well and achieved our targets, hopefully you agree that I will be able to create even more value for the group going forward. With that in mind, when the next salary review cycle comes, I'm wondering if it would be possible for us to propose a 15% increase on my current comp. What do you think? 给个准确的数字；用自己创造的价值和15%比例的薪资
     market facts - 和与自己联系的猎头多聊聊了解市场行情;
     Argument e.g. A recruiter recently approached me, and I found that the same role in a similar-sized company is paying x, which is 15% more than my current comp. I have also done other research which roughly agrees with that level. I am on the fence about whether to explore those options, because I am proud of the work we do here and we have a great team.
     However, this does provide me with some interesting data points, and I would like to ask, based on what you see, what is the likely outcome for salary increase in the coming year?
     If it is nothing out of the norm, can we build a case to see if it is possible for management to consider bringing my comp closer to current market value?
     即使没有获得涨薪，也可以让老板将自己放到priority list上。the squeaky wheel gets the grease. 即使没有成功，也不用气馁。下次有机会再继续跟进；淡定谈钱的心态。
